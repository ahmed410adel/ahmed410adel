### 🚀 About Me  

I'm a **cybersecurity engineer and penetration tester** with 3+ years of hands-on experience in:
- Web application security assessments (50+ PortSwigger labs solved)  
- Vulnerability analysis, exploit development, and PoC scripting  
- Developing automation tools and custom scanners using **Go**, **JavaScript**, and **Bash**  

Currently, I'm leading the development of an **AI-powered Web Vulnerability Scanner** — a private research project built in **Go** that combines:
- 🧩 **AI-based fingerprinting** for accurate target identification  
- ⚙️ **Client-side vulnerability detection** (analyzing JavaScript & DOM behavior)  
- 🌐 **Smart reconnaissance and passive discovery** for subdomains and endpoints  
- 🧠 **Adaptive scanning speed** that adjusts based on system performance  

> 🚧 *This project is under private development for research and testing purposes. A public overview and limited demo will be released once stable.*
